# Introduction to Serverless Computing

With serverless computing, you run applications without managing the underlying infrastructure.

In this lesson, you'll:

- Learn the differences between **unmanaged**, **managed**, and **serverless** compute services in AWS.
- Understand the **shared responsibility model** in the context of serverless computing.

---

## Unmanaged vs. Managed vs. Serverless

### üß± Unmanaged (e.g., Amazon EC2)

- Full control over the virtual machine.
- You handle:
  - Patching
  - Scaling
  - OS Management
- AWS manages:
  - Physical infrastructure
  - Underlying hardware

#### Analogy: High-end espresso machine
You grind the beans, control the pressure, adjust everything. Amazing flexibility‚Äîbut high maintenance.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Managed (e.g., ELB, SNS, SQS)

- Less overhead for you.
- AWS handles more of the operational tasks.
- You still configure and monitor resources.

#### Analogy: Coffee pod machine
Quick setup, fewer options, but less hassle.

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Serverless (e.g., AWS Lambda)

- No infrastructure to provision or manage.
- AWS handles:
  - Provisioning
  - Scaling
  - High availability
  - Maintenance
- You focus on:
  - Writing code
  - Deploying apps

#### Analogy: Buying a coffee from the caf√©
You just place your order and get your coffee‚Äîno cleanup, no setup.

## Shared Responsibility Model Recap

| Responsibility         | You (Customer)                 | AWS                             |
|------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Unmanaged (EC2)**    | OS, App, Network, Patching     | Hardware, Hypervisor             |
| **Managed (SQS, ELB)** | App logic, some config         | Scaling, Maintenance             |
| **Serverless (Lambda)**| Application code, logic        | All infrastructure management    |

---

## Summary

- EC2 gives control but requires effort.
- Managed services reduce work but offer less customization.
- Serverless maximizes simplicity by abstracting infrastructure completely.
- Choose based on your app needs: control vs. convenience.

## What's Next?

In upcoming lessons, you‚Äôll explore:
- AWS Lambda in detail.
- When and why to use ECS, EKS, and Elastic Beanstalk.
- Real-world use cases for different compute models.
