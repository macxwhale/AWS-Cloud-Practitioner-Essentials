# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials: AWS Lambda

## What is AWS Lambda?

AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that runs code in response to events without requiring infrastructure management. Itâ€™s also referred to as **Function as a Service (FaaS)**.

### Core Features:
- **No server management**: AWS handles infrastructure, availability, and scaling.
- **Event-driven execution**: Code runs only when triggered.
- **Automatic scaling**: Lambda scales up or down depending on demand.
- **Pay-per-use**: Charged only for compute time used, down to the millisecond.
- **15-minute limit**: Each function can run for up to 15 minutes.
- **Broad language support**: Java, Python, Node.js, and custom runtimes.

## Key Concepts

### Lambda Components:
- **Function**: The code that runs.
- **Trigger**: The event that invokes the function.
- **Runtime**: The execution environment that supports your chosen programming language.

### Example Use Case: Crab Classifier App
- Users upload images of crabs.
- Lambda is triggered by an image upload.
- The function classifies the image and sends a notification.
- AWS handles infrastructure, scaling, and patching.

## How Lambda Works

1. **Upload Code**: Deploy code as a Lambda function.
2. **Configure Trigger**: Connect to event sources like S3, SQS, API Gateway, etc.
3. **Execute on Trigger**: Code runs when the event occurs.
4. **Serverless Scaling**: AWS manages server provisioning and scaling.
5. **Billing**: Pay only for the time your code executes.

## Use Cases

### 1. Real-time Image Processing
- **Industry**: Social Media
- **Action**: Resizing and filtering uploaded images.
- **Why Lambda?** Automatically scales and costs only for processing time.

### 2. Personalized Content Delivery
- **Industry**: News Aggregator
- **Action**: Tailors articles based on user preferences at runtime.
- **Why Lambda?** Scales with traffic and runs only on user actions.

### 3. Real-time Game Event Handling
- **Industry**: Online Gaming
- **Action**: Updates scores, achievements, and leaderboards.
- **Why Lambda?** Handles thousands of real-time events with no server management.

## Lambda + SQS Demonstration

### Objective:
Use **Amazon SQS** with Lambda to create an event-driven workflow.

### Architecture:
- **SQS Queue**: Holds incoming messages.
- **Lambda Function**: Triggered by messages in the queue.

### Steps:

1. **Create SQS Queue**:
   - Manually add test messages.

2. **Create Lambda Function (e.g., "Lambert")**:
   - Use a prebuilt SQS blueprint.
   - Choose runtime (Node.js used in demo).
   - Name function and set architecture.

3. **Assign Execution Role**:
   - Use Amazon SQS Poller Policy.
   - Role grants permission to read from the SQS queue.

4. **Configure Trigger**:
   - Connect Lambda to the SQS queue.

5. **Verify Integration**:
   - Lambda processes the SQS messages immediately.
   - Logs available in **CloudWatch**.
   - Metrics: number of processed messages, execution logs, etc.

6. **Test Manually**:
   - Send messages to SQS queue.
   - Check logs to confirm successful processing.

## Summary

AWS Lambda provides a flexible, cost-effective, and highly scalable compute solution for building modern applications. By integrating with services like SQS, Lambda enables developers to create complex workflows without managing servers.
