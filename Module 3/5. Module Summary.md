# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials: Compute Services Summary

## Module Overview

This module provided a practical understanding of AWS compute services to help you select the most appropriate tool for various application needs.

### Key Learnings:

- **Serverless vs. Full Control**:
  - Use **fully managed services** like **AWS Lambda** or **AWS Fargate** for simplified operations and scalability.
  - Opt for **Amazon EC2** when you require **full control** over the computing environment.

- **Containers**:
  - Containers address **deployment consistency**.
  - **Amazon ECS** and **Amazon EKS** simplify the **management and scaling** of containerized applications.

- **Other AWS Compute Services**:
  - **Elastic Beanstalk**: Simplifies app deployment and scaling without infrastructure management.
  - **AWS Batch**: Ideal for large-scale **batch processing**.
  - **Lightsail**: Simplified VPS and container hosting with predictable pricing.
  - **AWS Outposts**: Brings AWS infrastructure **on-premises** for low-latency and hybrid cloud use cases.
