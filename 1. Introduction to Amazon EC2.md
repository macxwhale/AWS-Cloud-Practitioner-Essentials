# Introduction to Amazon EC2

## ⚙️ What Is Compute?

**Compute** refers to the processing power required to:
- Run applications
- Manage data
- Perform calculations

In cloud computing, compute power is:
- **On-demand** — provisioned only when needed
- **Remote** — accessible via the internet
- **Virtualized** — no need for physical hardware ownership

## 🖥️ What Is Amazon EC2?

**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** is AWS’s core compute service. It provides:
- Resizable virtual servers (called **instances**)
- Full control over configuration, storage, and networking
- **On-demand capacity** that can scale up/down quickly
- **Pay-as-you-go** pricing (billed only when active)

### ✅ Key Benefits of EC2

| Benefit           | Description                                                                 |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Flexibility       | Launch any number of instances with customizable OS, memory, CPU, and more |
| Cost-Effectiveness | No upfront investment; billed for actual usage                             |
| Speed             | Spin up new instances in **minutes**, not days                              |
| Scalability       | Auto-scale to meet traffic or compute demands                               |

## 🏗️ Traditional On-Premises vs Cloud-Based Compute

### 😓 On-Premises Challenges

- Buy and wait for **hardware delivery**
- Perform **manual setup, installation, and configuration**
- Locked into **fixed capacity**, regardless of demand
- Costly and **inflexible**

### 🚀 EC2 Cloud Benefits

- Launch compute resources in **minutes**
- Scale as traffic grows or shrinks
- No long procurement cycles
- **Avoid capital expense** for hardware

## 🧭 How Amazon EC2 Works

### Step 1: 🚀 Launch an Instance

- **Select an Amazon Machine Image (AMI)**  
  - Defines the OS and optional pre-installed software
- **Choose an instance type**  
  - Specifies CPU, RAM, and network performance

### Step 2: 🔌 Connect to the Instance

You can connect using:
- **SSH** for Linux
- **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** for Windows
- **AWS Systems Manager** for secure browser-based access

Apps can also communicate with the instance over the network.

### Step 3: 🛠️ Use the Instance

Once connected, you can:
- Run applications and services
- Install software
- Manage storage
- Execute OS-level commands
- Store and organize data

## 💡 Summary

Amazon EC2 simplifies computing by providing:
- **Virtual servers on-demand**
- **Speed and scalability** without infrastructure headaches
- **Pay-per-use** economics that help businesses stay lean

> EC2 is the foundation for running many types of modern cloud workloads—from web servers to big data jobs, gaming, ML, and more.
