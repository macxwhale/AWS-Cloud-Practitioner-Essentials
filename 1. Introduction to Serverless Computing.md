# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials – Compute Module Summary

## Overview of Compute in AWS

This module covered the key AWS services and tools used to deliver and scale compute resources efficiently and securely. You learned how AWS allows you to control computing capacity, optimize costs, and maintain availability through services like Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and Auto Scaling.

## Key Concepts

### Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

- **Function**: Launch and manage virtual servers (instances).
- **Customization**: Choose OS, instance type, storage, security settings, etc.
- **Flexibility**: Offers full control over compute environment.

### EC2 Instance Types

Different categories for various workloads:
- **General Purpose**: Balanced CPU, memory, networking.
- **Compute Optimized**: Ideal for compute-heavy tasks.
- **Memory Optimized**: For memory-intensive apps like databases.
- **Accelerated Computing**: For machine learning or graphic processing.
- **Storage Optimized**: High-speed, high-capacity local storage.

---

## EC2 Pricing Models

- **On-Demand Instances**: Pay per hour/second; ideal for short-term, unpredictable workloads.
- **Savings Plans & Reserved Instances**: Commit to usage for 1 or 3 years for significant discounts.
- **Spot Instances**: Use unused capacity at reduced prices; good for flexible, interruption-tolerant apps.
- **Dedicated Hosts/Instances**: Physical servers or isolated instances for regulatory/compliance needs.

---

## Load Balancing and Auto Scaling

### Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

- Distributes incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances.
- Enhances fault tolerance and availability.

### Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

- Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances to maintain performance and optimize cost.
- Responds to traffic spikes or drops.

---

## Application Integration Services

### Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)

- **Purpose**: Decouples and scales microservices or distributed systems.
- **Function**: Enables reliable message queuing between components.

### Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)

- **Purpose**: Sends notifications from the cloud to users or applications.
- **Channels**: SMS, email, or mobile push.

---

## Tools for Managing Compute Resources

- **AWS Management Console**: Web-based UI for resource management.
- **AWS CLI & SDKs**: Command-line interface and APIs for automation.
- **EC2 Instance Metadata**: Allows applications to access configuration data inside the instance.

---

## Best Practices and Use Cases

- Select instance types based on performance requirements and cost-efficiency.
- Use Auto Scaling and ELB together for a resilient architecture.
- Combine SQS and SNS for robust communication in loosely coupled applications.
- Monitor instance performance and adjust using AWS tools.
