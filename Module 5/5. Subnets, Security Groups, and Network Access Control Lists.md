# 🔐 Subnets, Security Groups, and Network ACLs in AWS

This lesson explains how to secure your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using subnets, security groups, and network access control lists (network ACLs). These tools are essential to manage and protect network traffic in AWS.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand how network traffic flows in a VPC.
- Explain how **security groups** work (stateful).
- Explain how **network ACLs** work (stateless).
- Identify your responsibilities under the **AWS Shared Responsibility Model** for VPC security.

## 🏰 Introduction to VPC Security

A VPC is like a **fortress**: nothing gets in or out without explicit permission via gateways and security configurations.

Key security tools:
- **Firewalls**
- **DDoS prevention**
- **Encryption**
- **Security groups**
- **Network ACLs**

This lesson focuses on the last two.

## 🗺️ Subnets: Public vs Private

Subnets are subdivisions of a VPC for organizing and isolating resources.

| Subnet Type   | Purpose                                                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Public Subnet | Resources like web servers that need internet access     |
| Private Subnet| Resources like databases that shouldn't be publicly accessible |

Subnets also **control access** to gateways and determine **routing behavior**.

## 📦 Network Traffic in a VPC

When a client sends a **packet** to your AWS resources:

1. The packet enters through the **Internet Gateway**.
2. Hits the **Network ACL** to check if it can enter the subnet.
3. If allowed, reaches resources inside (like EC2).

🔍 Think of **packets** as travelers and **ACLs** as passport officers checking entry/exit permission.

## 🧱 Network ACLs (NACLs)

**NACLs** are stateless firewalls that operate at the **subnet level**.

### 🔑 Characteristics

- **Stateless**: Checks every packet (inbound & outbound) with no memory of previous ones.
- Can **allow or deny** rules.
- Each subnet can have one NACL.
- Includes an **implicit deny rule** (if no rule matches, traffic is denied).

### 🔄 Example

- EC2 instance sends request.
- NACL checks outbound rule.
- Response returns → NACL checks inbound rule again, even though it's a response.

🛂 Like a passport officer who forgets you every time — "Sorry, don’t remember you. Check the list again."

## 🧍 Security Groups

**Security groups** are virtual firewalls at the **instance level** (e.g., EC2).

### 🔐 Characteristics

- **Stateful**: Remembers previous requests.
- **Default**:
  - All inbound traffic **denied**.
  - All outbound traffic **allowed**.
- Only **allow rules**, no deny rules.
- Return traffic is automatically allowed if the inbound request was allowed.

🏢 Metaphor: A doorman who checks the guest list on the way in, but lets everyone out.

### 🔁 Example

- EC2 instance sends a request.
- Security group remembers the outbound request.
- Response comes back → **automatically allowed** (no re-check).

## 🔁 Comparing Network ACLs vs Security Groups

| Feature                | Security Groups                  | Network ACLs                         |
|------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Scope**              | Instance-level (e.g., EC2)        | Subnet-level                          |
| **State**              | Stateful                          | Stateless                             |
| **Rule Types**         | Allow only                       | Allow and Deny                        |
| **Return Traffic**     | Automatically allowed            | Must be explicitly allowed            |
| **Use Case**           | Fine-grained instance control     | Broad subnet-level access control     |
