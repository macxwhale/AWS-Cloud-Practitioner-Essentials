# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials â€“ Introduction to Networking

## Learning Objectives

In this lesson, you learned to:

- Describe what a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is and its function.
- Explain what a **subnet** is and what it does.
- Distinguish between **public** and **private subnets**.

## What is Networking in AWS?

Networking in AWS refers to the infrastructure and services that enable data exchange and application hosting in the cloud. It's the backbone that connects all your AWS resources.

### Real-World Analogy: Coffee Shop

- Customers should interact with **cashiers** (public-facing).
- **Baristas** should remain focused and inaccessible to customers (private-facing).
- AWS networking allows this segmentation using VPCs and subnets.

## Key Networking Components

### Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC)

- A **logically isolated section** of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a defined virtual network.
- Helps manage **network resources and security**.

### Subnet

- A **range of IP addresses** within a VPC.
- Used to **organize resources**:
  - **Public Subnet**: Accessible from the internet (e.g., a customer-facing website).
  - **Private Subnet**: Not directly accessible from the internet (e.g., databases storing sensitive data).

## Understanding Network Diagrams

Architectural diagrams in AWS represent your cloud setup. They are essential for understanding:

- **Redundancy**
- **Security**
- **Scalability**

They also act as **blueprints** for building and maintaining AWS environments.

### Diagram Elements

- **AWS Cloud**: The outermost container.
- **Region**: Geographic area for low latency, compliance, and cost.
- **VPC**: A solid box indicating isolated networking space.
- **Availability Zones (AZs)**: Discrete data centers across a region, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.

## Subnet Types in Diagrams

### Private Subnets

- Used for sensitive/internal resources like databases.
- **Illustrated as solid boxes**.
- Not connected to the internet.

### Public Subnets

- Used for internet-facing resources like EC2 instances.
- **Connected via an internet gateway**.
- **Illustrated as dashed boxes**.

## Summary

AWS networking helps you **segment and control** access to cloud resources using VPCs and subnets. Diagrams are critical for visualizing and planning secure, scalable, and redundant cloud environments.
