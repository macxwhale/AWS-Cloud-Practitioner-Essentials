# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials – Launching an Amazon EC2 Instance & AMIs Summary

## Demo: Launching an Amazon EC2 Instance Using AWS Management Console

1. **Access EC2 Service**
   - Navigate to the EC2 console via recently visited, shortcuts, or search.

2. **Launch Instance Steps**
   - **Instance Name:** Assign a name to identify the instance later.
   - **Amazon Machine Image (AMI):** Select a template for the OS and pre-installed software.
     - Default choice: Amazon Linux AMI (suitable for general web server use).
   - **Instance Type:** Choose the computing power.
     - Example: t2.micro (1 vCPU, 1 GB RAM, Free Tier eligible).
   - **Key Pair:** Set up SSH login credentials.
     - Public key injected into the instance.
     - Private key kept by user.
   - **Network Settings:** Configure access.
     - Allow HTTP traffic from the internet (for a web server).
   - **Storage Options:** Define disk space and type.
     - Example: 8 GB gp3 Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume.
   - **Advanced Details – User Data:** Add startup script.
     - Used here to install and activate the Nginx web server upon launch.

3. **Launch and Access**
   - Click **Launch Instance**.
   - After launching, locate the public IP and open it in a browser.
   - Result: Running EC2 instance hosting a basic web server.

## Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)

### What is an AMI?

- A pre-built virtual machine image containing:
  - Operating system.
  - Storage configuration.
  - Architecture type.
  - Permissions for launching.
  - Pre-installed software.

### Uses of AMIs

1. **Custom AMIs:** Build your own with specific configurations and software.
2. **AWS Pre-configured AMIs:** Provided by AWS for common OS/software.
3. **AWS Marketplace AMIs:** Third-party specialized software offerings.

### Benefits of AMIs

- **Repeatability:** Launch multiple EC2 instances with consistent environments.
- Supports automated, scalable deployments.
- Reduces errors and ensures consistency in development and testing.
- Simplifies large-scale environment management.

## Key Takeaways

- Launching EC2 instances via the console involves setting name, AMI, instance type, key pair, network, storage, and optional user data scripts.
- AMIs are foundational templates that streamline creating identical environments.
- User data scripts allow automated configuration on instance startup.
- Consistency and scalability are core benefits of using AMIs.
