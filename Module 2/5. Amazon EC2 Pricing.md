# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials â€“ Amazon EC2 Pricing Summary

## Overview of EC2 Pricing Options

Amazon EC2 offers multiple pricing models to fit various usage patterns and budget needs:

### 1. On-Demand Instances
- Pay only for the compute capacity you use.
- Billing is per hour or per second, depending on instance type and OS.
- No upfront payments or long-term commitments.
- Ideal for:
  - Getting started.
  - Testing workloads.
  - Establishing a baseline usage.

### 2. Savings Plans
- Commit to a consistent usage amount ($/hour) over 1 or 3 years.
- Savings up to 72% off On-Demand pricing.
- Applies broadly to:
  - EC2 instances.
  - AWS Fargate.
  - AWS Lambda.
- Payment options: all upfront, partial upfront, or no upfront.

### 3. Reserved Instances (RIs)
- Best for steady-state or predictable workloads.
- Discounts up to 75% compared to On-Demand.
- Commitment term: 1 or 3 years.
- Payment options:
  - All upfront.
  - Partial upfront.
  - No upfront.
- Discount applies across:

- AWS can reclaim instances at any time with a 2-minute warning.
- Suitable for fault-tolerant and interruptible workloads.

### 5. Dedicated Hosts
- Reserve entire physical servers exclusively for your use.
- Ideal for security-sensitive or licensing-specific workloads (e.g., Windows, SQL Server).
- Full control over instance placement and resource allocation.
- Helps meet compliance and regulatory requirements.

### 6. Dedicated Instances
- Instances run on hardware isolated from other AWS accounts.
- Provide physical isolation without control over the underlying physical server.
