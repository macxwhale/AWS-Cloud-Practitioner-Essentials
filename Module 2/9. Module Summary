# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials  
## Module Summary: Compute Services

### Recap and Next Steps

In this module, you learned how compute services in AWS—especially **Amazon EC2**—enable scalable, flexible infrastructure for your applications. Key topics included:

- **Amazon EC2** instance types, pricing models, and use cases
- **Elastic Load Balancing** for distributing traffic across instances
- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling** to match demand dynamically
- **Amazon SQS** and **Amazon SNS** for decoupled and scalable communication

This knowledge enables you to:

- Choose the right compute resources for specific business needs
- Optimize cost and performance with appropriate instance types and pricing options
- Build resilient and decoupled application architectures using AWS messaging services
