# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials – Provisioning AWS Resources Summary

## Interacting with AWS Services

All AWS service interactions are performed via API calls. These APIs provide predefined methods to provision, configure, and manage AWS resources.

### Three Main Methods to Call AWS APIs

1. **AWS Management Console**
   - Browser-based, visual interface for managing AWS services.
   - Ideal for beginners, test environments, monitoring resources, viewing billing, and handling non-technical tasks.
   - Not ideal for repetitive production tasks due to manual navigation, which is error-prone.

2. **AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)**
   - Text-based interaction with AWS services via terminal commands.
   - Enables automation and scripting.
   - Example commands:
     - `aws ec2 run-instances` — create an EC2 instance.
     - `aws ec2 describe-availability-zones` — list availability zones.
   - Can be used interactively or incorporated into scripts and automated workflows.
   - Available across Windows, macOS, Linux, and AWS CloudShell (cloud-based terminal with CLI pre-installed).

3. **AWS Software Development Kit (SDK)**
   - Allows interaction with AWS resources through various programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, C++, .NET).
   - Supports integration of AWS services into applications.
   - Comes with documentation and sample code.
   - Example: Running a Python script using the SDK to list EC2 instances in a region.

### Summary of Access Methods

| Method                    | Description                                      | Best For                               |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| AWS Management Console    | Web interface with visual, easy workflows       | Beginners, non-technical users       |
| AWS CLI                  | Command-line tool for direct, scriptable control | Advanced users, automation           |
| AWS SDK                  | Language-specific APIs for integration          | Developers building AWS-enabled apps |

## AWS Shared Responsibility Model

- **AWS is responsible for:** Security *of* the cloud — hardware, infrastructure, physical data centers.
- **Customer is responsible for:** Security *in* the cloud — data, applications, OS configuration, access controls.

### Example: Amazon EC2

- Considered an unmanaged service.
- Customers must configure:
  - Security settings.
  - Guest OS management and patching.
  - Firewalls (security groups).

You will learn more about managed versus unmanaged services later.

## Key Takeaways

- AWS services are accessed and managed exclusively via API calls.
- Console is user-friendly but less ideal for repeatable, large-scale production tasks.
- CLI and SDK offer scalable, automatable methods.
- Understanding the Shared Responsibility Model is crucial for effective cloud security management.
