# AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials – Scaling Amazon EC2 Summary

## Overview: Scalability and Elasticity

- **Scalability:** The system’s ability to grow capacity over time to handle increased workload.
- **Elasticity:** Dynamic, automatic adjustment of resources up or down in response to real-time demand.

## The Business Challenge

- Planning for average vs. peak usage can be tricky and expensive.
- Over-provisioning wastes money; under-provisioning harms customer experience.
- Ideal solution: Provision resources precisely to demand—ensuring availability and cost efficiency.

## Redundancy and High Availability

- Set up multiple instances (e.g., order-taking “Morgan”) to avoid single points of failure.
- Deploy instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a Region.
- If one instance or AZ fails, others maintain service continuity.

## Scaling Types

- **Scale Out (Horizontal Scaling):** Add more instances to share the workload.
- **Scale Up (Vertical Scaling):** Increase power (CPU, memory) of existing instances.

### Example

- More customers → Adding more instances (scale out) handles concurrent requests better.
- Larger single instance (scale up) doesn’t speed up individual customer service.
- Scale out is often more effective for parallel workloads like web requests.

## Independent Scaling

- Different components (e.g., order-taking vs. order-processing) scale separately.
- Adjust resource allocation based on workload needs for each part of the system.

## Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling

- Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on demand.
- Uses Amazon CloudWatch metrics (performance, latency, etc.) to trigger scaling.
- Supports two approaches:
  - **Dynamic Scaling:** Real-time adjustment responding to fluctuating demand.
  - **Predictive Scaling:** Scheduled scaling based on anticipated future demand.

## Auto Scaling Groups (ASGs)

- A collection of EC2 instances managed as a group to scale in/out automatically.
- Key configurations:
  - **Minimum Capacity:** The least number of instances to always keep running.
  - **Desired Capacity:** Ideal number of instances to handle current workload.
  - **Maximum Capacity:** Upper limit to prevent over-scaling and control costs.

### Example Settings

| Setting           | Value | Purpose                                              |
|-------------------|-------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Minimum Capacity   | 4     | Always keep 4 instances running                      |
| Desired Capacity   | 6     | Target 6 instances to handle average demand         |
| Maximum Capacity   | 12    | Do not exceed 12 instances to limit expenses        |

## Cost Efficiency

- Pay only for the EC2 instances you use and when you use them.
- Auto Scaling balances optimal customer experience with cost savings.

## Key Takeaways

- Scalability focuses on long-term growth, elasticity on real-time demand.
- Horizontal scaling (scale out) generally better suits workloads with many parallel requests.
- Redundancy across AZs improves fault tolerance and availability.
- EC2 Auto Scaling automates resource management using performance data.
- Properly configured Auto Scaling groups ensure reliable, cost-effective cloud architecture.
