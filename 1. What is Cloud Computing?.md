# What is Cloud Computing?

## üìú History & Evolution

- **Early 2000s**: Amazon.com scaled its IT infrastructure to meet growing ecommerce demands‚Äîmore servers, storage, and compute power.
- Amazon developed internal standardized tools and mechanisms to improve efficiency.
- **2003**: Employees proposed offering these IT capabilities as rentable services to other companies.
- **2004**: AWS launched its first public service ‚Äî **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)**.
- **2006**: Followed by **Amazon S3** (storage) and **Amazon EC2** (compute).
- Initially adopted by startups, AWS gained traction due to its:
  - **Scalability**
  - **Cost-effectiveness**
  - **Ease of use**
- AWS rapidly expanded to include **databases**, **networking**, **analytics**, and more.
- Today, AWS powers a large portion of the internet, serving startups, corporations, governments, and beyond.

- **On-demand delivery**  
  Instantly access computing resources such as storage or compute power. Scale usage up or down within seconds.

- **Of IT resources**  
  Includes servers, databases, networking, storage, AI/ML tools, and more. Build, deploy, and manage apps using cloud infrastructure.

- **Over the internet**  
  Access services remotely from anywhere using a web browser. No need to maintain physical infrastructure.

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Deployment Models

| Deployment Model | Description |
|------------------|-------------|
| **Cloud**        | - Migrate existing resources or build apps in the cloud.<br>- Flexible, scalable, and fully managed. |
| **On-Premises**  | - Local data center infrastructure.<br>- Uses virtualization tools but lacks cloud scalability.<br>- Preferred for low latency or dedicated resources. |
| **Hybrid**       | - Combines cloud and on-prem resources.<br>- Useful for legacy apps or regulatory needs.<br>- Enables partial cloud adoption. |
| **Multi-cloud**  | - A type of hybrid approach.<br>- Uses multiple cloud providers.<br>- Avoids vendor lock-in and meets diverse requirements. |
